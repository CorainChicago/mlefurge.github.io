      I, like I am sure many of you, did plently of research before I decided to attend DBC. Besides reading all of the information on the DBC website, I visited peoples blogs, scanned bootcamp review websites and performed plenty of other google searches. Everything that I read was pretty consistent when it came to describing the DBC experience. DBC is unlike other bootcamps. They have a different attidue about your overall bootcamp experience. It's not just about learning how to code. Their focus on emotional intelligence and the idea of "learn to learn" really set them apart.

      For me, Shereef's Fireside Chat reinforced everything that I had read about DBC. He spoke about the outlook you should have when you enter the program as well as fears you may have. To me, this shows how the program is focused not just on what you learn, but how you learn and the environment that you learn it in. Through years of schooling and on the job training, its obvious that not everyone learns the same way. It seems that DBC understands this and incorporates it into their program. I'm excited to not only learn programming but to learn other skills that will be valuelable to me on the job.
